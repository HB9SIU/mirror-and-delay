# mirror-and-delay
already is ok !?? But....

Sorry, i have never used GetHub befor today. 
It is my first contribution.

First and important:
Thanks a lot for your mainpower and help, Ron.


I've had the hardware Proficio in operation for weeks.
At the beginning with the software "MSCC" under the files "Proficio".
Starting problem with driver. Fast and successful help
through "MultusSDR".
With the appearance of the variant "MSCC-PW" this app is installed.

Working with the "MSCC" app is basically possible,... but
2 phenomena show up here with me

- There is a signal  e.g. 3766 kc (CW) from a  Hf-Generator at the HF input at "Proficio"  Level -60dBm.
appears in the spectrum. e.g. not only the line at 3766 kc, but also another line at about 3752 kc.

If the receiving frequency is changed by the Proficio, the frequency lines in the spectrum change as a mirror image. 

This phenomenon also occurs with real received signals.
Maybe correctable with RX I/Q ??
But don't know how. Description is still missing in the manual.

- Initial situation: reception 80m band, mode: LSB Commands for transmission and frequency change in the band 
- are carried out immediately (less than 0.5 seconds). Then...
Frequency change to 20m band. Mode: CW: 5 seconds transmission. All subsequent commands such as frequency change (band) 
as well as changes in small steps or send commands are executed with a delay of up to 4 seconds.

If the "MSCC.PW" app is closed, the main window goes out immediately, but not the two sub-windows of the spectrum and waterfall. 
The voice information is still audible, even if the main window has already been deleted, but the two sub-windows
"Spectrum" and "Waterfall" are still active. Only after about 10 -15 seconds does the "MSCC" report with error messages.
Summary: All operations are executed successfully, but always with a delay of 4-5 seconds.
  Extremely difficult operation !!
  
  
  Thanks for any help.   73 de HB9SIU, John
  
  If i can, i will change my GitHub-Name from "aristo00" to "HB9SIU" soon
